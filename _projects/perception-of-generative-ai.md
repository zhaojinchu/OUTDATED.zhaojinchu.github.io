## Research goals
Generative AI is accelerating in the Gulf, yet conversations about trust and regulation are often imported from other regions. I led a cross-university team to collect evidence grounded in local experiences. Our central question: *What makes people across the Gulf region embrace, question, or resist generative AI tools?*

## Methodology
- Surveyed 527 participants across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar using bilingual instruments to capture nuanced sentiment.
- Applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze ten latent variables, including perceived usefulness, creative confidence, and regulatory expectations.
- Combined SEM outputs with qualitative interviews to validate constructs and surface emerging archetypes (enthusiasts, pragmatic optimists, cautious observers).

## Key insights
- **Trust is contextual:** Institutional trust strongly moderates adoption intent; transparent guidelines from universities and employers increase experimentation by 23%.
- **Creativity vs. control:** Artists and designers reported higher creative confidence but also higher concern for authorship rights, pointing to the need for clear attribution tooling.
- **Education as leverage:** Participants exposed to structured AI literacy programs demonstrated 18% higher resilience to misinformation prompts.

## Sharing the work
I presented the findings at Cambridge University, sparking panel discussions on regional policy design. The paper was later published in *The Political Economy of the Middle East* and is now used as a teaching resource in Logic Labs workshops to contextualize responsible AI practice.
